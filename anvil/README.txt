## Anvil 
Anvil is a platform that allows you to connect and collaborate on Jupyter notebooks. It provides a cloud-based environment where you can create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks with others in real-time. Anvil aims to make it easier for teams to work together on data analysis and machine learning projects by providing features such as version control, commenting, and sharing notebooks with collaborators. It also offers integrations with popular data science libraries and tools.

## How to get your hands dirty with Anvil 

To publish a notebook on the Anvil platform, follow these steps with a detailed example:
Step 1: Sign up and create a project on Anvil:

Go to the Anvil website (https://anvil.works) and sign up for an account.
Once logged in, click on the "New app" button to create a new project.

Step 2: Create a new notebook:

Inside your Anvil project, click on the "Add form" button.
Select the "Blank Form" option.

Step 3: Design your notebook's UI (User Interface):

Use the Anvil visual designer to add UI components to your form. For example, you can add buttons or text boxes.

Step 4: Add code to your notebook:

Switch to the "Code" view by clicking on the "Code" tab.
Write your code in the Python code editor. You can import libraries, define functions, or perform data analysis tasks.

Step 5: Publish your notebook:

Click on the "Publish app" button in the Anvil IDE.

Once logged in, click on the "New app" button to create a new project.

Step 2: Design the UI:

Inside your Anvil project, click on the "Add form" button.
Select the "Blank Form" option.
Use the Anvil visual designer to add UI components to your form. Here's the suggested design:

Add a button and name it "Predict".
Add a label and name it "Charges".
Add a group of two radio buttons, name the group "Sex", and label the buttons as "Male" and "Female".
Add a group of two radio buttons, name the group "Smoker", and label the buttons as "Yes" and "No".
Add three text boxes and name them "Age", "BMI", and "Children".



Step 3: Add code to calculate and display predicted charges:

Switch to the "Code" view by clicking on the "Code" tab.
Write code in the Python code editor to calculate and display the predicted charges. 

Implement a function that takes inputs from the UI components (age, BMI, children, sex, smoker status) and returns the predicted charges.
In the __init__ function, assign event handlers to the "Predict" button to call the prediction function and update the "Charges" label.
Update the "Charges" label with the predicted charges in the event handler for the "Predict" button.



Step 4: Publish your project:

Click on the "Publish app" button in the Anvil IDE.
Provide a name for your published app and click on the "Publish" button.
Anvil will generate a unique URL for your app, and it will be published and accessible to others.
